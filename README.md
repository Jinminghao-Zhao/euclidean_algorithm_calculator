# euclidean_algorithm_calculator
A repository for the Euclidean Algorithm Calculator I'm working on.

The calculator visually displays the Euclidean Algorithm process of finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers, and of course, also finds the GCD of said two integers.

I think the project is useful because oftentimes Math professors don't put in answer keys, so it's convenient to have something to double check that you're doing the process correctly and that you arrived at the right answer. And also, Intro to Ring Theory is HARD, so if it's possible, I'd like this project to be able to help the poor students taking the course, even if it's as small as something like this.

If you want to get started on this too, just understand how the Euclidean Algorithm works for integers, and you'll probably have a basic understanding of how the code is supposed to go. If you want to add complexity, make the calculator work for polynomials as well. Anything beyond that, it's up to you because this as far as my Ring Theory knowledge goes!

I'm the only person maintaining/contributing to the project right now, so if you want help for whatever reason, just reach out to me at jinminghaozhao@gmail.com! :tada:

Currently:
- Working on making the calculator work for polynomials, and eventually, polynomials in F[x]
